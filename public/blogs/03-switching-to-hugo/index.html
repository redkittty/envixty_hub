Introduction
Hello, It has been over two months since I last updated the website, You might be concerned but fear not, I am still here.
I have been experimenting with linux over the past two months and my modern system is way different than the old system.
I switched back from Doom Emacs to Neovim, I am back to using the terminal as my main way of interacting with the computer.">

<p>Hello, It has been over two months since I last updated the website, You might be concerned but fear not, I am still here.</p>
<p>I have been experimenting with linux over the past two months and my modern system is way different than the old system.</p>
<p>I switched back from Doom Emacs to Neovim, I am back to using the terminal as my main way of interacting with the computer.</p>
<p>I have switched to DWM as my main window manager.</p>
<p>With all this change to the way I do things on the computer, it is only appropriate that I also switch the website.</p>
<h1 id="why-the-switch">Why the switch</h1>
<p>Mainly, I wanted to stop using Emacs, To turn org into html, you need Emacs. I wanted to switch to regular HTML but I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered.</p>
<p>But, When I watched a Luke Smith Video, I discovered Hugo and I was fasinated with it, At first I thought it was just a Javascript framework, but it barely uses Javascript</p>
<p>It is actually based</p>
<h1 id="what-is-hugo">What is Hugo</h1>
<p>Hugo is a static website generator. The way it works is that you write pages (like this one) in Markdown, and then Hugo converts it over to HTML.</p>
<p>You can use themes to customize the way your Hugo Website is, (You can seperate the CSS File from the theme to the website static directory).</p>
<p>Hugo also automatically generates an RSS Feed for your website, allowing people who want to check your blog to just subscribe to it in their RSS Reader.</p>
<p>You can also use Hugo serve to run a local instance of your Hugo website on your machine for testing</p>
<p>Hugo is just more fit for making a website than ORG-EXPORT is</p>
