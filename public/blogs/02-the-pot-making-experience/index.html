Introduction
Hello, So during State Testing, I was bored after taking the test due to the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t do anything after the test until everybody was done the Test.
So I discovered I liked making Clay Pots. This was due to the fact that the person in my Test Room was an Art Teacher. I liked how it allowed me to express my creativity.
My First Clay Pot
For my First Clay Pot, I decided to make it a Pinch Pot, basically what I did was that I made a Sphere-Like Shape and from the top, I dug my thumb deeper to make a Clay Pot.">

<p>Hello, So during State Testing, I was bored after taking the test due to the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t do anything after the test until everybody was done the Test.</p>
<p>So I discovered I liked making Clay Pots. This was due to the fact that the person in my Test Room was an Art Teacher. I liked how it allowed me to express my creativity.</p>
<h1 id="my-first-clay-pot">My First Clay Pot</h1>
<p>For my First Clay Pot, I decided to make it a Pinch Pot, basically what I did was that I made a Sphere-Like Shape and from the top, I dug my thumb deeper to make a Clay Pot.</p>
<p>But Midway through making the Pot, something terrible happened. So apparently the Pot was too thick causing it to explode in the Kiln. I decided to keep going and make the Pot.</p>
<p>For the Glaze, I added a Dark-Blue Colored Glaze, When applying the glaze, it looked like a light-purple color but then when it came out the kiln it was indeed Dark-Blue.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the Pot:

<h1 id="pot-numero-dos">Pot Numero Dos</h1>
<p>After the first Pot, I decided to make another Pot, I was doing the same thing and then I realized I was making a rectangle shape so I decided to make a small container.</p>
<p>I had it in two parts, Part 1 was the container. Part 2 was a lid that went on top of the container.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the Pot (Doesn&rsquo;t have the lid):

<h1 id="the-class-pot">The Class Pot</h1>
<p>After these Clay Pots, I had gotten assigned to make a clay pot. The way we did it was a slab pot where You would make it peice by peice and then slip and score to make the Pot.</p>
<p>What ended up happening when I tryed slipping and scoring the two ends of the walls was that the walls broke and they kept on breaking. I wanted a new clay slab for the walls.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing was shaping the clay, and Slipping and Scoring the Plastic to the Pastic -&gt; LeatherHard Clay that was the bottom and the handle.</p>
<p>For the Glaze, I decided to use a bright red (it&rsquo;s my favorite color). Turns out the Red Clay has a defect in that it isn&rsquo;t as strong as the other clay, so instead of doing 3 coats. I had to do 5 coats with the red glaze.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the Pot:

<p>In the End, I really enjoyed making Clay Pots, I would recommend anybody who hasn&rsquo;t made a clay pot to do so.</p>
