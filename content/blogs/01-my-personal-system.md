# Operating System
I use Linux as my main Operating System

Yes I know you are gonna say that it is infact "GNU/Linux"

I know it is actually GNU/Linux

The Linux Distro I use is Arch Linux (btw): ![Arch Logo](/img/arch.png)

|                      FEATURES                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|    Rolling Release (get newest software first)    |
| Arch User Repository (Repo of user-made software) |
| Less Bloated (Less Software installed by default) |

If you are new to linux, I would recommend installing a Distro like [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.org) due to their ease-of-use

# Window Manager
I use [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org) as my Window Manager

Here is why:
|                                                                              REASONS WHY                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Configured in a real language (due to being configured in lua, you can do anything with this wm)                                                                    |
| Tiling (Instead of being floating where windows are ontop of other windows, this is tilied meaning windows are TILED next to other Windows, Improving Productivity) |
| Efficiency (This WM primary uses the keyboard instead of the mouse, Improving Productivity)                                                                         |

Here is a screenshot of my AwesomeWM config:

# Utilities
## Basic Utils
For my text editor, I have both [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)

Nowadays, I use [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) way more than Neovim

Here is why:

|                          REASONS WHY                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|          GUI (things like photo previews are possible)         |
| Org-Mode (A comprehensive note-taking and website making tool) |
|    Magit (TUI frontend for Git, easier to use than CLI git)    |
| Doom Config (Makes it easier to manage config by splitting it) |

For my Terminal Emulator, I use [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

Here is why

|                      REASONS WHY                     |
|------------------------------------------------------|
|      GPU-POWERED (Allows terminal to be faster)      |
| Kittens (Python Programs for interacting with kitty) |

## Advanced Utils
For my system shell I use Dash

Here are the reasons why

|                 REASONS WHY                 |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Faster (This is due to it only being POSIX) |

Instead of using SUDO I use DOAS, this is because it is less bloated
