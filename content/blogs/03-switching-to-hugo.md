# Introduction

Hello, It has been over two months since I last updated the website, You might be concerned but fear not, I am still here.

I have been experimenting with linux over the past two months and my modern system is way different than the old system.

I switched back from Doom Emacs to Neovim, I am back to using the terminal as my main way of interacting with the computer.

I have switched to DWM as my main window manager.

With all this change to the way I do things on the computer, it is only appropriate that I also switch the website.

# Why the switch

Mainly, I wanted to stop using Emacs, To turn org into html, you need Emacs. I wanted to switch to regular HTML but I couldn't be bothered.

But, When I watched a Luke Smith Video, I discovered Hugo and I was fasinated with it, At first I thought it was just a Javascript framework, but it barely uses Javascript

It is actually based

# What is Hugo

Hugo is a static website generator. The way it works is that you write pages (like this one) in Markdown, and then Hugo converts it over to HTML.

You can use themes to customize the way your Hugo Website is, (You can seperate the CSS File from the theme to the website static directory).

Hugo also automatically generates an RSS Feed for your website, allowing people who want to check your blog to just subscribe to it in their RSS Reader.

You can also use Hugo serve to run a local instance of your Hugo website on your machine for testing

Hugo is just more fit for making a website than ORG-EXPORT is
