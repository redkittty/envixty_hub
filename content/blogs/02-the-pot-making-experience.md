# Introduction
Hello, So during State Testing, I was bored after taking the test due to the fact that I couldn't do anything after the test until everybody was done the Test.

So I discovered I liked making Clay Pots. This was due to the fact that the person in my Test Room was an Art Teacher. I liked how it allowed me to express my creativity.

# My First Clay Pot
For my First Clay Pot, I decided to make it a Pinch Pot, basically what I did was that I made a Sphere-Like Shape and from the top, I dug my thumb deeper to make a Clay Pot.

But Midway through making the Pot, something terrible happened. So apparently the Pot was too thick causing it to explode in the Kiln. I decided to keep going and make the Pot.

For the Glaze, I added a Dark-Blue Colored Glaze, When applying the glaze, it looked like a light-purple color but then when it came out the kiln it was indeed Dark-Blue.

Here is a photo of the Pot:

# Pot Numero Dos
After the first Pot, I decided to make another Pot, I was doing the same thing and then I realized I was making a rectangle shape so I decided to make a small container.

I had it in two parts, Part 1 was the container. Part 2 was a lid that went on top of the container.

Here is a photo of the Pot (Doesn't have the lid):

# The Class Pot
After these Clay Pots, I had gotten assigned to make a clay pot. The way we did it was a slab pot where You would make it peice by peice and then slip and score to make the Pot.

What ended up happening when I tryed slipping and scoring the two ends of the walls was that the walls broke and they kept on breaking. I wanted a new clay slab for the walls.

What I ended up doing was shaping the clay, and Slipping and Scoring the Plastic to the Pastic -> LeatherHard Clay that was the bottom and the handle.

For the Glaze, I decided to use a bright red (it's my favorite color). Turns out the Red Clay has a defect in that it isn't as strong as the other clay, so instead of doing 3 coats. I had to do 5 coats with the red glaze.

# Summary
In the End, I really enjoyed making Clay Pots, I would recommend anybody who hasn't made a clay pot to do so.
